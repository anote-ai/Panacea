"""Implicit RSI feedback-signal detection for document Q&A — issue #220 (slice 2).

Slice 1 (`database/qa_feedback.py`) added the `qa_feedback` table and the
`log_qa_feedback()` writer. This slice derives an **implicit** signal from chat
history with no UI change: a *rapid follow-up*. If the user asks again within a
short window of the previous answer, that answer was probably incomplete — a
soft-negative training signal for the RSI loop.

Same constraints as slice 1: opt-in (`ENABLE_RSI_FEEDBACK`) and best-effort
(detection/logging must never break a chat).

Wiring: call `record_followup_if_any(user_email, chat_id, chat_type)` at the
start of handling a new user turn, before the new message is persisted. That
scores the previous assistant answer instead of the new user question.
