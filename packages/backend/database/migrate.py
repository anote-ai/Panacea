"""Applies pending SQL files in database/migrations/ to the configured DB.

Tracks applied migrations in a schema_migrations table so each file runs
at most once. schema.sql seeds that table for migrations whose changes
are already part of the fresh-install schema, but that seed only takes
effect when MySQL runs schema.sql itself (a genuinely empty data
directory via docker-entrypoint-initdb.d) — a long-lived dev DB whose
volume predates that seeding, or whose schema was applied ad hoc, can
already have a migration's columns/tables without schema_migrations
knowing it. _apply_migration tolerates exactly that: a statement that
fails because its effect already exists is treated as a no-op rather
than aborting the whole run.

Run manually with `python -m database.migrate`, or automatically on
container start (see entrypoint.sh) — a MySQL named lock keeps concurrent
callers (e.g. multiple ECS tasks starting during a rolling deploy) from
applying the same migration twice at once.
